✅ RASPBERRY PI DEPLOYMENT FILES

📁 Location: pi-deployment/

This folder contains Pi-optimized versions of the main scripts.
For most users, the main AstraIPS scripts work fine on Pi.

Files Included:
✅ mqttlive_pi              - Pi-optimized mqttlive
✅ snortlive_pi.sh          - Pi-optimized snortlive
✅ mqtt_final_pi.lua        - Pi-optimized Snort config
✅ enhanced_ai_inspector_pi.lua - Pi-optimized AI inspector

🎯 Note:
The main AstraIPS scripts (in project root) now auto-detect paths
and work on any system including Raspberry Pi. These Pi-specific
files are kept for reference but usually not needed.

📋 Recommended Approach:
Just use the main scripts:
  cd AstraIPS
  sudo ./installer/install.sh
  sudo ./mqttlive

The installer handles everything automatically.
